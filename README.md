# Rock-Paper-Scissor (easiest)

Its a basic game of rock paper and scissor using basics of python. 

I have defined a function named play which will execute the working of the game and have added a block which will ask the user if the user wants to play the game or exit the game.

Concepts used in this program : 1) if-else statements  2) Defining a function  3) Use of random module  4) Use of while loop
